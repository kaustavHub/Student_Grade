# Project Title: Student Performance Prediction


Project Description: This project aims to analyze student performance data and build a predictive model to estimate final grades (G3). The project utilizes a dataset containing various student attributes, including demographics, family background, and academic records.

Steps:

Data Loading and Exploration: The project begins by loading the student performance dataset ("student-mat.csv") and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA involves examining the data's structure, distributions, and potential relationships between variables. This is done using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

Data Preprocessing: To prepare the data for modeling, preprocessing steps are performed:

Handling Missing Values: The code checks for missing values in the dataset and addresses them if any are found.
Feature Engineering: A new feature, 'GradeAvg', is calculated by averaging the student's grades (G1, G2, G3).
Feature Selection: Irrelevant features like 'school' and 'age' might be dropped to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.
Data Transformation: Categorical variables are converted into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding. For example, 'sex', 'address', and other categorical variables are mapped to numerical values.
Model Selection and Training: A Linear Regression model is chosen for predicting the final grade (G3). The data is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained using the training data.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using the testing data to assess its predictive accuracy. The code uses metrics like R-squared to measure the model's performance.

Project Goal: The project's primary goal is to build a model that can accurately predict student performance based on available data. This can be valuable for educators to identify students who might need additional support and to understand the factors influencing academic success.
